# Robin's Feedback

## Back-end technology
**Incomplete**: Back-end unable to persist data and return JSON.

## Front-end technology
**Incomplete**: No functional AJAX requests to the back-end application.

There is a good deal of Javascript on your front-end. However, it looks like little-to-none of it was actually written by you... Instead, you incorporated a bunch of libraries and plug-ins. While you plugged them in successfully, that doesn't really indicate proficiency with Javascript.

## Code quality
**Progressing**: Code lacks proper formatting, includes commented out, non-functional code, or otherwise contains major issues of quality (DRY, naming, etc)

Please see my inline comments on this pull request.

## Deployment and Functionality
**Progressing**: Application contains minimal functionality, but deployment is non-functional, or application contains major errors when used

The app shows an error page.

## Planning / Process / Submission
**Incomplete**: No submission received, or submission does not contain basic documentation of planning (ERD, wireframes, commit history, etc)
